    <string name="Random_lorem">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.\n
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.\n
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.\n\n
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.\n\n
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n

        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.\n\n
        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\n</string>

        Now it`s time for some honest confession.\n\n
        I have created this application because I believed that I should give you something on your Birthday and you mean a lot to me.\n\n
        Don`t take my work as something negative because I did not created it to mean something negative.\n
        If you honestly think that I`ve done something for you and you appreciate my work give me an honest `Thank You`.\n
        And if you want to give me coffee treat for my work i will not say `No`.\n\n
        Although I would very much prefer the coffee treat....ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‹

        I have tried to make a Personal Assistant for you. It is still in Beta. It was a part of my Final Year Project but they`ve rejected it.\n\n
        I had limited time so that is why this Assistant is not that Smart enough. But it can still answer to normal `Hi` ,`Hello` type of conversation.
        It can also open websites if you tell her to open that.\n\nI know you`ll not enjoy it much. But it is still there.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

    <string name="musicDialogMsg">I have realized that you love listening to Music.\nSo.. here is a Music Player for you.I don`t know what type of songs you like so it does not come with any preloaded songs.\nYou know what`s special about this Music Player?? This Music Player is exclusive to you and only you have access to this Player.\n\n
        \tI wanted to implement some more features like playlist,album sorting and notification control but due to lack of time i have not been able complete
        these implementation. But I think you`ll like this player because I`ve spent huge time to make this Player.\nImplementing it on Android Oreo(8.1) was a huge deal.\nI`ve added a shortcut to this player.Long press on launcher icon and you`ll see the shortcut.\n\nAt the end I`ll just
        say `TRY PLAYING SOME MUSIC ON IT`.ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

        First of all I wish you a very Happy Birthday and Many Many happy returns of the day!!!\n\n
        I`ve came to realize that you people very much believe in posting photo collage on Birthdays.
        So I`ve designed this swipe card styled photo gallery for you on your birthday.\n
        You can also add new photos to this Gallery by pressing the + sign on the top right hand side corner.\n
        You can also delete a existing card by touching the card on the top-right corner.\n\n
        Some photos are collected from your status updates and some others from other peoples in case you want to know.\n
